        <p style="text-align: justify;">Since credit card purchases have become more common, we have setup a procedure to better handle credit card purchases; rather than making many manual adjustments. You will want to follow these steps:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol type="1" class="MadCap1">
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="1">You will want to setup a new general ledger account near your Accounts Receivable account, and title it something similar to "Credit Card Clearing".</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="2">You will need to setup a new <a href="../Setup/Bank Accounts.htm">Bank Code</a> for the credit card. When you get to the field "Post G/L&#160;Cash Account", you will need to set it to the general ledger account you created in step 1. <i>Note</i>: if you have only been using one bank account, you may need to go into the Accounts Payable parameters and set the "Allow multiple bank codes" field to "yes".</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="3">For any vendors that you will be primarily paying with the credit card, you will want to go into <a href="../Setup/Vendors.htm">Vendor Setup</a>, and set the standard bank code on those accounts to be the new credit card bank code. You also have the option of manually setting the bank code on invoices as you process them.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="4">Your Order Entry and Purchase Order Receiving will continue as normal. When AP&#160;Invoice Entry occurs, you will want to verify that the bank code is set correctly.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="5">Entering your payment to the credit card company is the next step. We recommend that you wait and process this when you receive your credit card invoice/bill. You will need to come up with a convention for numbering your checks. One option would be to use the month, year, and sequence counter. Remember that you will be paying off these invoices on the new bank code that was setup in step 2. You can select the invoices that need to be paid through either <a href="../Check Processing/Manual Check Entry.htm">Manual Check Entry</a>, or <a href="../Check Processing/Automatic Invoice Selection.htm">Auto Invoice Selection</a>. The number of invoices you need to pay will usually determine the method that you choose, with more invoices being easier to pay through Auto Invoice Selection.<br /><br />Manual Check Payment - Select that you are entering a hand written check. Enter a check number. Enter a vendor that has invoices that need to be paid from your credit card bill. Enter the total amount of their invoices to be paid at this time. Then select all of their invoices that will be paid. After entering all of the checks and selecting all of the invoices that need to be paid off, continue to the <a href="../Check Processing/Manual Check Audit Report Update.htm">Manual Check Audit/Update.</a><br /><br />Auto Invoice Selection - When selecting your invoices to be paid, you will simply need to limit the selection to the specific bank code that you are paying, and possibly by a date range. You will then want to run the <a href="../Check Processing/Suggested Payment Report.htm">Suggested Payment Report</a>. At this point you can still add/remove invoices from the selection as needed. Continue to <a href="../Check Processing/Check Printing.htm">Check Printing</a>, where you can enter in a starting check number, and print these to stock paper. Then run your <a href="../Check Processing/Cash Disbursements Journal Update.htm">Cash Disbursements Journal/Update</a>.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="6">Now you are ready to setup your invoice to the credit card company. You will do this by going directly into <a href="../Invoicing/AP Invoice Entry Panel.htm">AP&#160;Invoice Entry</a>. This invoice will be entered for your credit card vendor, and the amount should be equal to the total amount of your check run in step 5, plus or minus any additional charges. The value posted to your general ledger to offset the vendor invoices will be posted to the Credit Card Clearing account. Other charges should be posted their appropriate expense accounts.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="7">A check to the credit card will then be issued when the invoice is due, along with your other payables.</li>
