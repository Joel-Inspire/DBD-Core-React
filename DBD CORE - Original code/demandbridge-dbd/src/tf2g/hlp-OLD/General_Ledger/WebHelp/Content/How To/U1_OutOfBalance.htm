        <p>When running your <a href="../Updates/Detail Transaction.htm">Detail Transaction Register</a>, you may occasionally receive a message that informs you that your postings are out of balance. This would usually be due to a previous update being interrupted, or from having some sort of programming issue. Here are the steps that you should use to most quickly find and correct your out of balance condition:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol type="1" class="MadCap1">
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="1">Go to the end of your report and determine the difference between your total debits and total credits. This will let you know the total amount that needs to be found.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="2">The report is divided up by source journal. So there are subtotals throughout the report based upon which area of the system made the update. Sales Journal, Cash Receipts, Check Processing, etc. Start working your way through the report, looking at the subtotal for each source journal. If you find a problem with the subtotals of a specific source journal, you will then need to look through that source journal for an out of balance posting. Make a note of the amount that you are out of balance within that section. If the amount is equal to the total amount from step 1, then this is the only section of the journal that will need to be corrected. If it is not, then you will need to look through the other source journal sections as well.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="3">Begin looking through the individual postings of your out of balance source journal. When you find one that is out of balance, make a note of how much the difference is, and what the audit control number is. If the amount it is out of balance is equal to the amount from step 2, then that is the only out of balance condition within this section. If it is not, then you will need to continue searching through this section.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="4">Using the audit control number, you will need to find a copy of the original journal that was updated. This process is made easier if you have the Image Library, and can do a search on the audit control number. You can always use your hard copy that was printed out and filed as well.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="5">Using the original journal, you should be able to determine where the out of balance condition originated from, and figure out where a correcting posting needs to be made.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="6">Repeat steps 2 through 5 until you have found all of the out of balance conditions that would have led to your total from step 1.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="7">Enter a <a href="../Journal Posting/General JE.htm">General Journal Entry</a> to make your correcting posting(s). Instead of posting these as a "JE" type, we would recommend making each posting to the correct source journal that it should have originally been updated to.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="8"><a href="../Journal Posting/General JE Update.htm">Update</a> your new postings.</li>
            <li class="MadCap3" style="text-align: justify;" value="9">Run your <a href="../Updates/Detail Transaction.htm">Detail Transaction Register</a> report again. You should now be in balance.</li>
