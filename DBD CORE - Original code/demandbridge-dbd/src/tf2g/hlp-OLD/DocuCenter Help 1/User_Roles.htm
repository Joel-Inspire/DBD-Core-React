<h1>User Roles</h1>

<h3>Designer</h3>

<p class="Normal">The Designer is responsible for creating the documents and
content. Once all the documents are ready on the Designer’s workstation, the
Designer has to add a new Item to the DocuCenter catalog.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">The Designer creates a new item and adds it to the above
catalog view. The item is literally built up piecemeal, line by line, each line
describing one step of how the item is supposed to be printed or created by the
Manufacturer eventually. This process is made easy with the GUI provided in
DocuCenter. A view of this process is shown below.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">Each line can be associated with a file containing relevant
content. This file can be attached to the right line using the <i>Upload Artwork</i> link provided. This file
is delivered to the Manufacturer for production down the line when this item is
ordered by any Customer. The Designer submits the item to the Manager after the
build process is completed. Along with the item submission, at this time, the
Designer may ask for a proof of the item to be created by the Manufacturer. The
Designer also has the option to save the item for some time and return to it
for more work if required. In this case, the item will not be open to access by
other Designers or users.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Manager</h3>

<p class="Normal">The Manager user manages the DocuCenter catalog. The
Designer submits the finished item to the Manager. The Manager is responsible
for ensuring that corporate guidelines have been followed in the creation of
the item by the Designer. The Manager reviews the item and then sets a price on
the item (both sell and cost prices) according to the contracted rates for that
Customer and Manufacturer.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">If a proof has been requested by the Designer, the Manager
has the option of creating a Proof Request Order which will cause the
Manufacturer to create a proof and send to the Designer. If there are no
problems with the way the item is set up and the Designer is satisfied, the
next step for the Manager is to activate the item, making it available to other
users. Items which fail the review process are returned to the Designer for
changes or corrections. Once an item is active in the catalog, Customers can
order a printed version of the active item; Designers can edit the item and
update it to make it current.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Buyer</h3>

<p class="Normal">Buyers can browse the DocuCenter catalog and select items
they are interested in. Buyers may add their selected items into a Shopping
Cart. They can checkout and place a purchase order for these items with the
Manufacturer.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">Purchase orders for an item will not release immediately to
the Manufacturer. They are held in a wait-queue by the system until a <i>Cutoff Time</i>. This cutoff time is the
lead time required by the Manufacturer to receive the purchase order, print the
material and ship the packages to the customer by the deadline. This time
period is setup for every customer profile individually in the DocuCenter
system. The significance of this is that an item may be continually revised
within the system even after a purchase order has been placed for the item all
the way until the cutoff time. The system takes care of making sure that the
Manufacturer obtains the absolutely latest version of the item’s
content/artwork at the time that the order was released to them.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">Order history is available for under a customer’s profile.
Previous orders may be viewed using the <i>View
Order History</i> page.</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>

<p class="Normal">The Manufacturers receive purchase orders placed by the
Customers. They are alerted to the fact that they have a purchase order by an
email notification sent by the system. Typically the Manufacturer views the
purchase order for the first time in the Order History view. They have the
ability to download a ZIP archive of the purchase order. The archive typically
consists of Excel format files describing the Purchase Order and all the Items
which were ordered as part of this order. In addition, all the artwork files
attached to the items are also included in this archive.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">In case the manufacturer has already downloaded a
substantial portion of the artwork files either as part of a previous order or
is missing a few files because the item has been revised since a previous order
for that item, the system provides them with the ability to selectively
download artwork files attached to items based on their <i>Upload Timestamps</i>. This saves the Manufacturer from having to spend
time and bandwidth in downloading files they may already have downloaded as
part of a previous purchase order.</p>
