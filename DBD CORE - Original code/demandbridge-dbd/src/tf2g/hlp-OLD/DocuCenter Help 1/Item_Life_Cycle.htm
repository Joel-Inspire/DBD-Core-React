<h1>Item Life Cycle</h1>

<h3>Create Item</h3>

<p class="Normal">To create an item, the user must be enabled as a Designer.
In the <b>Search Product Catalog</b> page,
click on the “<b>Create New Item</b>”
button. Enter information required by the form. If a proof is required, click option
“Yes” for “<b>Proof required</b>”. Enter
proof delivery information. Enter item production specifications for Text and
Bindery. This spec information is used by the Manufacturer when the item is
produced.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">The next page presents a form where the user can describe
how the item is to be built. Any artwork that is required can be attached at
the appropriate step in the build instructions. Each step can only have one
artwork file attached to it.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">If the user is finished with building the item, the item can
be submitted to the Manager for review (“Submit Item” button). However, if the
user needs to work on the item some more later, the item can be saved for
editing later (“Save Item” button). Clicking “Submit Item” makes the item show
up in the Manager’s view of the catalog where it can be reviewed. Till such
time as the item is not reviewed and processed by the Manager, other users will
not be able to see and access the revised item. Clicking “Save Item” only saves
the item state and allows this Designer user to access it later for more
editing later on. </p>

<h3>Review Item</h3>

<p class="Normal">When an Item is submitted to the DocuCenter Manager for
review, there is an email notification sent to all DocuCenter managers
associated with the current item’s catalog. The Manager can pull up the item
for review from the <b>Search Product
Catalog</b> page by searching using the item name. Clicking on the item name in
the results page shows a summary view of the item. When the item is reviewed,
the Manager checks to verify whether the item satisfies the rules and
guidelines established for the DocuCenter system. </p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal" style="margin-left:.5in; "><b>Item Passed Review</b>: If the item does not pass scrutiny, the Manager
returns the item to the Designer with an optional email notification using the <b>Activate Item</b> page. The item state is
set to <i>Item Saved</i> and submitted. The
Manager has the option to send an email notification to the Designer about the
item being returned for revision. The optional custom email message can be
entered in the <b>Notes</b> text area if
the Manager desires.</p>

<p class="Normal" style="margin-left:.5in; ">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal" style="margin-left:.5in; "><b>Item Failed Review</b>: If the item passes the Manager’s scrutiny, the <b>Manage Item </b>link allows the Manager to
specify the Price and Cost information for the item. Once the item has pricing
information associated with it, there are two options at this point.</p>

<h3>Proof Item</h3>

<p class="Normal">If “<i>No</i>” is checked
for “Proof required” on the <b>Create Item</b>
page, the Manager can click on <b>Activate
Item</b>. If “<i>Yes</i>” option is checked
for “Proof required” on the <b>Create Item</b>
page, the Manager clicks on <b>Create Proof
Order</b> and is taken to the proof order form. The proof order requests that
the manufacturer produce the item using the build information exactly as it is
entered by the designer. The shipping information specified by the Designer is
used to deliver the proof produced.</p>

<h3>Activate Item</h3>

<p class="Normal">Once the item has been reviewed by the Manager, the item can
be activated. This makes it available in the catalog for Buyers to view and
order. The Manager clicks on the Activate Item link. The item status is changed
to <i>Item Active</i>. Submitting the
changes at this time will activate the item. </p>

<h3>Order Item</h3>

<p class="Normal">Search for the item on the <b>Search Product Catalog</b> page. Select the <b>Order Item</b> link. Enter the quantity of items you would like to
order. Click <b>Submit</b> to add this item
to the <b>Shopping Cart</b>. Click on <b>Checkout</b> to go to the <b>Create Order</b> page. Enter the order
details including the Shipping details and Billing details. Review the order
and submit the order information. An order confirmation page with the system <b>Purchase Order Number</b> will be shown
after the purchase order is created successfully.</p>

<h3>My Catalog</h3>

<p class="Normal">All items which were ordered by a Buyer will be available as
long as they remain active in a DocuCenter area called the <b>My Catalog</b>. The My Catalog screen shows all the items from the
user’s order history which may still be reordered. Items disappear from the My
Catalog when they are deleted by the user or if they are no longer active.</p>
