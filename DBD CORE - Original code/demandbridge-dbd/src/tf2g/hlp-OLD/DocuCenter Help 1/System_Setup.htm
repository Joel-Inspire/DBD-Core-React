<h1>System Setup</h1>

<p class="Normal">DocuCenter is a web application. Users access the system
over the web using a login name and password. User behavior in DocuCenter is
completely governed by access control lists. An <i>Access Control List</i> is a set of permissions, each of which allows a
user access to a section or functionality of the system. Every user has an <i>Access Control List</i> (ACL) associated
with their profile which determines their role and access to the DocuCenter
system, its functions and user interface. The initial system setup process can
be divided into two different parts: </p>

<p class="Normal" style="margin-left:.5in; "><b>Incentrix Setup</b>: This part of the process involves setup of
the Incentrix system. This is typically performed by an administrator. This
setup phase involves creation of Customer profiles, Manufacturer profiles and
associated user profiles. User groups, consisting of a set of available users,
are defined for the purpose of applying roles and permissions in bulk.
Available ACL templates are used to assign the permissions to user groups.</p>

<p class="Normal" style="margin-left:.5in; "><b>DocuCenter Setup</b>:  This phase deals with the setup of
DocuCenter specific data only. This includes customer catalogs, billing and
shipping information, cost center information, etc. This setup may be performed
by an administrator or by customer users empowered to perform these actions.</p>

<h3>Incentrix Setup</h3>

<p class="Normal"><b>Customer</b>:
Customer company information is entered and a profile is created for the
customer. The TopForm customer id can be entered in this step.<b> </b></p>

<p class="Normal"><b>Users</b>: Customer user profiles are created and
associated with the appropriate user groups if there are user groups present at
this point.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b>User Groups</b>: A
user group is a named set of users. Operations on users can be conveniently
carried out in bulk using user groups. The operation on a group is applied to
all users present in the group. User groups may only house users of the same
kind: Customer users, Manufacturer users or Administrators.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b>Manufacturer</b>:
Manufacturer company profile information is entered. Manufacturer users are
created in the same step as their setup is different from customer users.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b>Administrators</b>:
Administrator users are privileged users created for managing the Incentrix
system and its services. An administrator user may only be created by another
administrator. Also, permission allowing creation of an administrator user has
to be granted for this administrator.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b>Access Control Lists</b>: By default, a newly created user’s profile does not have permissions
associated with it. This prevents the user from accessing any functions in the
Incentrix system. Access Control List templates are available for Customer,
Manufacturer and Administrator users. Permissions have to be granted to the
user groups using these templates.</p>

<h3>DocuCenter Setup</h3>

<ol style="margin-top:0in; " start="1" type="1">
 <li class="Normal">Separate
     the users into groups with each group consisting of users requiring similar
     permissions. Tailor and apply DocuCenter permissions to user groups as
     appropriate.</li>
 <li class="Normal">Assign
     administrator users to companies as appropriate.</li>
 <li class="Normal">Assign
     DocuCenter Purchase Order Managers and DocuCenter Catalog Managers across
     companies as required.</li>
 <li class="Normal">Create
     a set of build sheet product descriptors for the use of Designers in item
     creation.</li>
 <li class="Normal">For
     each customer, enter shipping location information.</li>
 <li class="Normal">For
     each customer, enter billing location information.</li>
 <li class="Normal">For
     each customer, enter cost center information.</li>
 <li class="Normal">Enter
     lead time information for each customer as appropriate. The system
     defaults to a lead time of 96 hours in case there is no lead time set for
     the customer.</li>
</ol>
