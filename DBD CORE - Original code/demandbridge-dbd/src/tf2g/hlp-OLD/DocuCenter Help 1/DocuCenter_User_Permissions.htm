<h1>DocuCenter User Permissions</h1>

<p class="Normal">Users may be assigned access to DocuCenter using the
following set of permissions. Their descriptions and purpose are listed below:</p>

<h3>Module Access</h3>

<p class="Normal">The DocuCenter tab is visible only if this permission is set
for the user. This permission affect all types of users.</p>

<h3>Customer/Buyer</h3>

<p class="Normal">A customer user is enabled to use the shopping cart features
or their <b>My Catalog</b> view for
ordering items from the catalog. They may search their company catalogs for
active items and place purchase orders. </p>

<h3>Designer</h3>

<p class="Normal">The Designers create and revise items in the catalog. The
designer is also able to create new catalogs as required. They are able to view
information on the current state of items in the catalog and whether they are
active or under revision. If an item is being revised, they will be able to see
which of their fellow Designers is working on the item. If the item is
currently locked by a Designer user, that user will see an <b>Edit Item</b> link on their catalog view.</p>

<h3>Editor</h3>

<p class="Normal">An Editor is also a Designer who has the ability to override
locks on an item under revision by another Designer who is editing the item.</p>

<h3>Catalog Manager</h3>

<p class="Normal">The DocuCenter catalog manager is usually a Distributor user
who reviews and activates an item and manages the catalog for their customers.</p>

<h3>Supplier/Manufacturer</h3>

<p class="Normal">This permission is required by any user who is registered
under a supplier profile on DocuCenter. This gives them the ability to search
their purchase order history and view orders and download artwork as required.</p>

<h3>Costcenter Manager</h3>

<p class="Normal">Cost centers are required to be specified by the Buyer and
the Manager when a regular purchase order and a proof order are being created
respectively. The list of cost centers available for a customer is displayed in
a dropdown list on the Create Order pages. This permission allows the user to
manage cost center information for their company.</p>

<h3>Purchase Order Manager</h3>

<p class="Normal">By default, Buyers have access to view only their purchase
order history. This permission allows users to view and edit all purchase
orders placed by other users of their company.</p>

<h3>Invoice Management function</h3>

<p class="Normal">This permission allows the user (Manufacturer and Customer)
access to the invoice tab and functions within DocuCenter. </p>

<h3>Manage build map descriptors</h3>

<p class="Normal">Designers need to specify the build instructions for an item
in the Build sheet section of the <b>Create
Item</b> workflow. Each row has a part description dropdown list allowing the
Designer to select the relevant part quickly using the dropdown. This list can
be custom configured per customer by a user with this permission enabled.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Modify Lead Time</h3>

<p class="Normal">Lead time is required to be specified for every customer
whose Buyers may place purchase orders on items in their catalogs. DocuCenter
is a Print On Demand system. This means that the items to be produced are not
made available to the Manufacturer significantly in advance. The orders are
queued in the system until just before they are due to be produced and
delivered to the Buyers by the Manufacturers. The description, contents and
specs of the items which have to be produced are made available to the
Manufacturer at this time. Users with this permission will be required to
determine what this lead time needs to be for their customers and enter it into
the system. The system uses the lead time to keep track of when the queued
order needs to be activated and routed to the manufacturer.</p>

<h3>Reassign catalog managers</h3>

<p class="Normal">By default, a catalog manager has access to review and
catalogs and items designed by users of his or her company. When a catalog
manager of one company needs access to catalos of other companies also, access
has to be enabled explicitly by a privileged user. This permission grants the
privilege of enabling cross-company access of catalogs to an administrator
user.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b><span style="color:red; ">Note:</span></b> Permission may be applied to Administrators
only.</p>

<h3>Address Manager</h3>

<p class="Normal">Shipping and Billing addresses are required selections in
the purchase order workflow. A Buyer needs to select from among a set of
shipping locations and billing locations defined for the buyer’s company. The
“Address Manager” user may create or update billing and shipping locations for
creating a purchase order.</p>

<h3>Reassign purchase order managers</h3>

<p class="Normal">By default, a purchase order manager has access to view and
change all purchase orders placed by users of his or her company. When a
purchase order manager user of one company needs access to PO information
relating to other companies also, access has to be enabled explicitly by a
privileged user. This permission grants the privilege of enabling cross-company
access of purchase order information to an administrator user.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b><span style="color:red; ">Note:</span></b> Permission may be applied to Administrators
only.</p>
