<h1>2.4 Manufacturer</h1>
<p class="Normal">The Manufacturers receive purchase orders placed by the
Customers. They are alerted to the fact that they have a purchase order by an
email notification sent by the system. Typically the Manufacturer views the
purchase order for the first time in the Order History view. They have the
ability to download a ZIP archive of the purchase order. The archive typically
consists of Excel format files describing the Purchase Order and all the Items
which were ordered as part of this order. In addition, all the artwork files
attached to the items are also included in this archive.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">In case the manufacturer has already downloaded a
substantial portion of the artwork files either as part of a previous order or
is missing a few files because the item has been revised since a previous order
for that item, the system provides them with the ability to selectively
download artwork files attached to items based on their <i>Upload Timestamps</i>. This saves the Manufacturer from having to spend
time and bandwidth in downloading files they may already have downloaded as
part of a previous purchase order.</p>
