<h1>3.1 Create Item</h1>
<p class="Normal">To create an item, the user must be enabled as a Designer. Click
the “<b>Create New Item</b>” button in the <b>Search Product Catalog</b> page. </p>

<p class=StyleHeading310pt><a name="_Toc82598623">3.1.1 Create Item: Specification Form</a></p>

<p class="Normal">Enter information required by the item specification form.
If a proof is required, click option “Yes” for “<b>Proof required</b>”. Enter proof delivery information. Enter item
production specifications for Text and Bindery. This spec information is used
by the Manufacturer when the item is produced.</p>

<p class=StyleHeading310pt><a name="_Toc82598624">3.1.2 Create Item: Buildmap</a></p>

<p class="Normal">The next page presents a form where the user can describe
how the item is to be built. Any artwork that is required can be attached at
the appropriate step in the build instructions. Each step can only have one
artwork file attached to it. Each step represents a step or operation required
to build this item. If this item is a complex item being made up of existing
lower level items then choose to “Add New Item”.</p>

<p class=StyleHeading310pt><a name="_Toc82598625">3.1.3 Submit or Save Item</a></p>

<p class="Normal">If the user is finished with building the item, the item can
be submitted to the Manager for review (“Submit Item” button). However, if the
user needs to work on the item some more later, the item can be saved for
editing later (“Save Item” button). Clicking “Submit Item” makes the item show
up in the Manager’s view of the catalog where it can be reviewed. Till such
time as the item is not reviewed and processed by the Manager, other users will
not be able to see and access the revised item. Clicking “Save Item” only saves
the item state and allows this Designer user to access it later for more
editing later on. </p>
