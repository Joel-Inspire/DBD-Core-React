<h1>5.15 Reassign suppliers to customers</h1>
<p class="Normal">A DocuCenter supplier is not associated with any company by
default. After you assign a supplier to a customer, the catalogs belonging to
that company are visible and accessible to the supplier. The supplier will also
be available for selection in the customer's shipping address information page.</p>

<p class="Normal"> </p>

<p class="Normal">You may associate a supplier with more than one company.
This may be done by selecting a supplier and assigning multiple companies to
this user. A Company may also be selected and associated with more than one
supplier. This allows many suppliers to access and download a company's catalog
items.</p>
