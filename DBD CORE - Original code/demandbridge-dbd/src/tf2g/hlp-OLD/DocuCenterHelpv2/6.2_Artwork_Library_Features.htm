<h1>6.2 Artwork Library Features</h1>
<p class="Normal">DocuCenter allows a designer to upload and attach artwork
files in place directly to their items. These artwork files are stored in a
library on the server. Once a file is uploaded, the file is available to the
designer from then on which allows items to be created quickly. Using the
artwork library, files can be reused and attached to items easily saving time,
space and expense. </p>

<p class="Normal">Users can manage their artwork library and find out easily
which files are being used and which are not. They can add new files and delete
unused files. This allows customers to make sure they only keep files which are
required.</p>
