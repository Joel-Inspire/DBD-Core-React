<h1>3.6 My Catalog</h1>
<p class="Normal">All items which were ordered by a Buyer will be available as
long as they remain active in a DocuCenter area called the <b>My Catalog</b>. The My Catalog screen shows all the items from the
user’s order history which may still be reordered. Items disappear from the My
Catalog when they are deleted by the user or if they are no longer active.</p>
