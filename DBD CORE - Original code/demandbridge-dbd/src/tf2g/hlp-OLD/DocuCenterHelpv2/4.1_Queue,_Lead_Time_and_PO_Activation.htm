<h1>4.1 Queue, Lead Time and PO Activation</h1>
<p class="Normal">Purchase orders may be placed for items months in advance.
These orders are held in a queue by DocuCenter and are not released to your
manufacturer partners until a few days before the material is due to be
produced and shipped. This allows your customers to make revisions to items
until the last minute even if there are orders placed for them in the system.
This is all totally transparent to your customers and they are free to revise
their items to their heart’s content. </p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">The administrator with appropriate permissions can set the
lead time (in hours) which controls the number of hours by which a purchase
order is released by the Manufacturer in advance so as to give them the time to
produce and deliver it.</p>

<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Normal">When a purchase order is activated, it is sent to the
Manufacturer ready for download. An email notification is also sent out to all
the Manufacturer contacts.</p>
