<h1>6.0 What is artwork?</h1>
<p class="Normal">When an item is created by a designer, files are uploaded
and remain attached to the item through out its life cycle. These files persist
through revisions unless they are explicitly deleted or dropped out the item’s
buildmap by the designer. These files are generically referred to as artwork.
Artwork may be of any format and size (based on customer artwork rules) and may
contain any content.</p>
