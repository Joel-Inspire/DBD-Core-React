<h1>2.3 Buyer</h1>
<p class="Normal">Buyers can browse the DocuCenter catalog and select items
they are interested in. Buyers may add their selected items into a Shopping
Cart. They can checkout and place a purchase order for these items with the
Manufacturer.</p>

<p class="Normal">Purchase orders for an item will not release immediately to
the Manufacturer. They are held in a wait-queue by the system until a <i>Cutoff Time</i>. This cutoff time is the lead
time required by the Manufacturer to receive the purchase order, print the
material and ship the packages to the customer by the deadline. This time
period is setup for every customer profile individually in the DocuCenter
system. The significance of this is that an item may be continually revised
within the system even after a purchase order has been placed for the item all
the way until the cutoff time. The system takes care of making sure that the
Manufacturer obtains the absolutely latest version of the item’s
content/artwork at the time that the order was released to them.</p>
