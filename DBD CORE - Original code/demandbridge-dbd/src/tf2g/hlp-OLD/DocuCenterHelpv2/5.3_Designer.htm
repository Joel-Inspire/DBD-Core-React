<h1>5.3 Designer</h1>
<p class="Normal">The Designers create and revise items in the catalog. The
designer is also able to create new catalogs as required. They are able to view
information on the current state of items in the catalog and whether they are
active or under revision. If an item is being revised, they will be able to see
which of their fellow Designers is working on the item. If the item is
currently locked by a Designer user, that user will see an <b>Edit Item</b> link on their catalog view.</p>
