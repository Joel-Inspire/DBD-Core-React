<h1>5.11 Modify Lead Time</h1>
<p class="Normal">Lead time is required to be specified for every customer
whose Buyers may place purchase orders on items in their catalogs. DocuCenter
is a Print On Demand system. This means that the items to be produced are not
made available to the Manufacturer significantly in advance. The orders are
queued in the system until just before they are due to be produced and
delivered to the Buyers by the Manufacturers. The description, contents and
specs of the items which have to be produced are made available to the
Manufacturer at this time. Users with this permission will be required to
determine what this lead time needs to be for their customers and enter it into
the system. The system uses the lead time to keep track of when the queued order
needs to be activated and routed to the manufacturer.</p>
