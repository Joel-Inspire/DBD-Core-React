<h1>1.1 Incentrix Setup</h1>
<p class="Normal"><b>Customer</b>:
Customer company information is entered and a profile is created for the
customer. The TopForm customer id can be entered in this step.<b> </b></p>

<p class="Normal"><b>Users</b>: Users for a customer company are created. They
may be assigned to specific user groups according to the company’s overall user
hierarchy or deployment plan. If there are no user groups present at this point,
user groups can be created (see User Groups in Incentrix Setup).</p>

<p class="Normal"><b>User Groups</b>: A
user group is a named set of users. Operations on users can be conveniently
carried out in bulk using user groups. An operation on a user group may be
assigning a specific role or permission. The operation is applied to all users
present in the group. User groups may only house users of the same kind and are
of three different types: Customer users, Manufacturer users or Administrators.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b>Manufacturer and
Manufacturer users</b>: Manufacturer company profile information is entered.
Manufacturer users are created in the same step as their setup is different
from customer users.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b>Administrators</b>:
Administrator users are privileged users created for managing the Incentrix
system and its services. An administrator user may only be created by another
administrator. Also, permission allowing creation of an administrator user has
to be granted for this administrator.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b>Access Control Lists</b>:
By default, a newly created user’s profile does not have permissions associated
with it. This prevents the user from accessing any functions in the Incentrix
system. Access Control List templates are available for Customer, Manufacturer
and Administrator users. Permissions have to be granted to the user groups
using these templates.</p>
