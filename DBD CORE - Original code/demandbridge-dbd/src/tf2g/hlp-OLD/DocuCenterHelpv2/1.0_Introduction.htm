<h1>1.0 Introduction</h1>
<p class="Normal">DocuCenter is a web application. Users access the system
over the web using a login name and password. User behavior in DocuCenter is
completely governed by access control lists. An <i>Access Control List</i> is a set of permissions, each of which allows a
user access to a section or functionality of the system. Every user has an <i>Access Control List</i> (ACL) associated
with their profile which determines their role and access to the DocuCenter
system, its functions and user interface. The initial system setup process can
be divided into two different parts: </p>

<p class="Normal"><b>Incentrix Setup</b>: This
part of the process involves setup of the Incentrix system. This is typically
performed by an administrator. This setup phase involves creation of Customer
profiles, Manufacturer profiles and associated user profiles. User groups,
consisting of a set of available users, are defined for the purpose of applying
roles and permissions in bulk. ACL templates are available in Incentrix. These
ACL templates are used to assign specific permissions to user groups.</p>

<p class="Normal"><b>DocuCenter Setup</b>: 
This part of the process deals with the setup of DocuCenter specific
data only. This includes customer catalogs, billing and shipping information, cost
center information, etc. This setup may be performed by an administrator or by
customer users empowered to perform these actions.</p>
