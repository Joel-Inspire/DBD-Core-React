        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This parameter only affects customers that are set as "issue based" instead of "counted". This can be set to Yes or No. This parameter works in conjunction with the previous parameter (Method of updating Issues based usage). If the previous parameter is set to Current Shipment, then Yes is recommended. If the previous parameter is set to Next Shipment, then No is recommended.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The previous parameter instructs the system on when usage is to be recognized. This parameter allows you to define whether the usage quantity captured by the system should be prorated over the time between shipments or whether the entire usage quantity should be recognized in the period in which it was billed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note: The actual prorating algorithm used by the system divides the usage quantity by the number of DAYS that have elapsed between issues to determine a Daily Usage Rate. Distribution of usage across months is then done by multiplying the number of days that passed in each month by the Daily Usage Rate. The proration computations in the following examples have been simplified to add clarity.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Set to Yes - Using the Yes option will instruct the system to accept the captured usage quantity (which is dependent upon the previous parameter setting) as usage in the period in which it was shipped. Under this option, there would be no change in the usage figures.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Set to No - Using the No option will instruct the system to prorate the captured usage quantity over the time period between the current ship date and the previous ship date. Under this option, usage figures would change as time elapsed between shipments.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If in the previous parameter you have set usage to be determined by Current Shipments, then the resulting usage would now be prorated  over the time period between the current ship date and the last ship date. This is referred to as backward proration. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>As an example, let's say that we shipped 10,000 vouchers to our customer on January 15, with our last shipment of these forms occurring on November 1. Since we have set the previous parameter to Current Shipment and No to update usage into current period, the system will prorate the shipment between January 15 back to November 1. As a result January will show a usage equal to fifteen (15) days worth of usage (since the forms were shipped on January 15). We next shipped 12,000 vouchers on March 31. The system will now prorate the shipment of 12,000 vouchers in March from March 31 back to January 15. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If in the previous parameter you have set usage to be determined by the Next Shipment, then the resulting usage would now be prorated  over the time period between the last ship date and the current ship date. This is referred to as forward proration.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>As an example, let's say that we shipped 10,000 vouchers to our customer on January 15, with our last shipment of these forms occurring on November 1. For simplicity sake, we will assume that the system has calculated a usage of 2,000 vouchers for the fifteen days in January. We next shipped 12,000 vouchers on March 31. Since we have set the previous parameter to Next Shipment and No to update usage into current period, the system will prorate the shipment of January 15 forward for the days between January 15 and March 31. As a result January will show a usage equal to sixteen (16) days worth of usage (since the forms were shipped on January 15). The system will now prorate the shipment of 10,000 vouchers in January from January 15 forward to March 31.</p>
